== Fragments Test-System

We use a fairly simple Makefile based Test-System. The Test-System knows about two kinds of Tests. The first one are all Code-files ending with -valid.cpp. The Test-System expects them to compile without an error and to run and signal if the test was a success with the exit-status (normal unix conventions: 0 => ok, everything else than 0 => failure). The other ones are alle Code-files ending with -invalid.cpp. The Test-System expects them not to compile.

Tests may not write to stderr or stdout if they succeed! Tests may not expect input and should work completly without user interaction!

Running the Test-System requires GNU/make.

-- Remember: Tests can only proof the existence and _not_ the absence of Bugs --
